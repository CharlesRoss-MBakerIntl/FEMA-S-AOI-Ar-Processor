    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook dedicated to combining feature classes in the coastal and riverine geo databases into a single feature class with a WGS 84 spatial reference. In this notebook, we will merge the newly converted feature classes and store them in their respective Geo Databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- **Merge Feature Classes**: The main goal is to combine the converted feature classes from the Coastal and Riverine datasets into a single feature class with a WGS 84 spatial reference.\n",
    "- **Organize Data**: By merging the feature classes, we create standardized datasets for spatial analysis and visualization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before proceeding, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed in your Python environment:\n",
    "- `tkinter` for creating GUI dialogs\n",
    "- `arcpy` for geospatial analysis\n",
    "- `pandas` for data manipulation\n",
    "- `os` and `glob` for file handling\n",

    "Letâ€™s get started by loading our libraries and running the code to combine the feature classes! Remember to select the cell and press `Ctrl + Enter` to execute the code."

    "### Step 3: Process Coastal and Riverine Feature Classes and Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will iterate through the list of feature classes in the coastal and riverine geo databases, merge them into respective single feature classes. Here's a detailed explanation of how to execute this process for both coastal and riverine data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Up Environment**:\n",
    "    - Start by ensuring that the arcpy library is correctly installed in your Python environment for geospatial analysis.\n",
    "    - Determine if you want to prevent the output feature classes from being added to the map by setting `arcpy.env.addOutputsToMap = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specifying Workspace for Coastal Data**:\n",
    "    - Set the workspace (`cst_gdb`) variable to the path where the coastal geo database is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing Coastal Feature Classes**:\n",
    "    - Initialize counters for the coastal processes, such as total_counties, coastal_succeed, coastal_fail, and coastal_fail_list.\n",
    "    - Assign a name (`cst_combined_name`) for the combined feature class for coastal data.\n",
    "    - Obtain a list of feature classes in the coastal geo database using `arcpy.ListFeatureClasses()`.\n",
    "    - Iterate through each coastal feature class, skipping the empty feature class, and attempt to merge them into the combined feature class.\n",
    "    - Update success and failure counts, print messages for successful merges or failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specifying Workspace for Riverine Data**:\n",
    "    - Set the workspace (`riv_gdb`) variable to the path where the riverine geo database is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Processing Riverine Feature Classes**:\n",
    "    - Initialize counters for the riverine processes, such as total_counties, riverine_succeed, riverine_fail, and riverine_fail_list.\n",
    "    - Assign a name (`riv_combined_name`) for the combined feature class for riverine data.\n",
    "    - Obtain a list of feature classes in the riverine geo database using `arcpy.ListFeatureClasses()`.\n",
    "    - Iterate through each riverine feature class, skipping the empty feature class, and attempt to merge them into the combined feature class.\n",
    "    - Update success and failure counts, print messages for successful merges or failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Printing Summary Reports**:\n",
    "    - After processing all feature classes for both coastal and riverine data, print summary reports showing the total number of feature classes processed, successful merges, and failed merges for each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Displaying List of Failures**:\n",
    "    - If there are any failed merges for coastal or riverine data, list them explicitly with the feature class name and reason for failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to run this code in a Python environment with arcpy installed and verified workspace variables set correctly. By the end of this process, the newly combined feature classes for coastal and riverine data will be stored in their respective geo databases for further analysis and visualization."
