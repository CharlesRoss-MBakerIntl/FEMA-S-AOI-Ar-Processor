    "# Introduction to the S_AOI_Ar Processor\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook dedicated to combining the processed riverine and coastal floodplain data collected by Michael Baker for the FFRMS Project. In this notebook, we will systematically cycle through the floodplain datasets, specifically focusing on extracting relevant files identified as **S_AOI_Ar** from both the Riverine and Coastal data categories, then combining them into a single feature layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- **Extract Specific Files**: Our primary focus will be on locating and extracting files named **S_AOI_Ar** from the Riverine and Coastal datasets.\n",
    "- **Combine Data**: Finally, we will merge these extracted files into a single feature class for easier analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we dive in, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:\n",
    "- `tkinter` for creating GUI dialogs\n",
    "- `arcpy` for geospatial analysis\n",
    "- `pandas` for data manipulation\n",
    "- `os` and `glob` for file handling\n",

    "Let’s get started by loading our libraries and setting up the environment!\n",

    "1. **Cycling Through Folders**: For each month folder (e.g., \"00August\", \"01September\", etc.), we check if it exists.\n",

    "2. **Counting County Folders**: We count the number of county folders present in each month folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing Each County Folder**:\n",
    "   - For each county folder, we construct the path to its corresponding \"Shapefiles\" folder and verify its existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing Coastal and Riverine Shapefiles**:\n",
    "   - **Coastal Shapefile Processing**:\n",
    "     - The script constructs the path to the coastal shapefile (`S_AOI_Ar.shp`).\n",
    "     - If the shapefile is valid, it sets a name for the new feature class that will be created in the **CoastalConverted.gdb**.\n",
    "     - The coastal shapefile is converted to a feature class and reprojected to WGS 84 using the `arcpy.Project_management` function.\n",
    "     - The success or failure of this conversion is recorded, updating the respective counters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Riverine Shapefile Processing**:\n",
    "     - The script similarly constructs the path to the riverine shapefile.\n",
    "     - After verifying its validity, it sets a name for the new feature class in the **RiverineConverted.gdb**.\n",
    "     - The riverine shapefile is then converted to a feature class and reprojected to WGS 84.\n",
    "     - Again, success or failure is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workflow, we will have a structured set of feature classes for both coastal and riverine data, accurately projected in the WGS 84 spatial reference system, with comprehensive tracking of the processing outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the processing, it’s crucial to review the summary results to check for any failures during the conversion processes. This involves inspecting the counters for both coastal and riverine shapefiles to identify how many conversions were successful versus how many failed. Addressing any failures will ensure that all data is accurately processed and ready for further analysis.\n",
