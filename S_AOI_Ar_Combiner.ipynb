    "# Introduction to the S_AOI_Ar Processor\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook dedicated to combining the processed riverine and coastal floodplain data collected by Michael Baker for the FFRMS Project. In this notebook, we will systematically cycle through the floodplain datasets, specifically focusing on extracting relevant files identified as **S_AOI_Ar** from both the Riverine and Coastal data categories, then combining them into a single feature layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- **Extract Specific Files**: Our primary focus will be on locating and extracting files named **S_AOI_Ar** from the Riverine and Coastal datasets.\n",
    "- **Combine Data**: Finally, we will merge these extracted files into a single feature class for easier analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we dive in, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:\n",
    "- `tkinter` for creating GUI dialogs\n",
    "- `arcpy` for geospatial analysis\n",
    "- `pandas` for data manipulation\n",
    "- `os` and `glob` for file handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started by loading our libraries and setting up the environment!\n",
    "\n",
    "When wanting to run a cell of code, first select the cell, then press `Ctrl + Enter`"
